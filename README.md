# Pybots
Development of bots and automation in general by using Python ( with Selenium, JS)

**List of applications:**
>**project_1)** This project automates the webpage [Vagas](https://www.vagas.com.br) where it is opened up and logged in by using input values (username and password) \
>**project_2)** This automates the task of extracting and converting Youtube videos to Mp3 format by using a website that perform conversion, so the goal is to scale up the process allowing you to download more than one (Note: it was used a Regex pattern to match content from musicas.txt )
